# Calculator Web App

A simple calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
- Responsive and clean user interface
- Real-time display of input and results
- Clear button to reset the calculation
- Decimal support

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the calculator by clicking the buttons to input numbers and operations.
4. Press `=` to see the result.
5. Press `C` to clear the display.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the calculator layout and button logic
- `calculator.css`: Stylesheet for the calculator UI
- `first.js`: JavaScript file for additional logic (if any)

## How It Works
- The calculator interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS.
- Button clicks update the display and build the arithmetic expression.
- The `eval()` function is used to compute the result when `=` is pressed.

## Note
This calculator is for educational/demo purposes. Using `eval()` can be unsafe for untrusted input in production applications.
